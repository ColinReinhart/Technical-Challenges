### 2. Add Two Numbers

**Status:** Solved  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Topics:** Linked List, Math, Recursion  

**Description:**  
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Example 1:**  

![atn]

Input:  
```plaintext
l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
```  
Output:  
```plaintext
[7,0,8]
```  
Explanation:  
```plaintext
342 + 465 = 807.
```  

**Example 2:**  
Input:  
```plaintext
l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
```  
Output:  
```plaintext
[0]
```  

**Example 3:**  
Input:  
```plaintext
l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
```  
Output:  
```plaintext
[8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```  

**Constraints:**  
- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 9
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
