## Problem Description

Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

## Examples

### Example 1:
![st1]
**Input**:  
`p = [1,2,3]`, `q = [1,2,3]`  
**Output**:  
`true`  

### Example 2:
![st2]
**Input**:  
`p = [1,2]`, `q = [1,null,2]`  
**Output**:  
`false`  

### Example 3:
![st3]
**Input**:  
`p = [1,2,1]`, `q = [1,1,2]`  
**Output**:  
`false`

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-10⁴ <= Node.val <= 10⁴`.
